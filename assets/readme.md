🔬 Visions – 3D Human Anatomy Web Explorer
🌐 Live Site → arpitray.github.io/visions

Visions is a fully immersive web-based 3D anatomy explorer that allows users to interact with realistic human organs right from their browser. Dive into the complexity of the human body in a visually rich, interactive experience powered purely by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🧠 What This Project Offers
🫀 Interactive 3D Organs
Users can explore human organs like the brain, heart, and lungs with full 3D rotation and perspective, offering a hands-on anatomical learning experience.

🧭 Mouse-Controlled Exploration
Click, drag, and orbit around organs to understand their spatial structure like never before — all with simple and intuitive cursor controls.

📱 Responsive Design
The interface adjusts to desktops, tablets, and mobiles — maintaining usability and aesthetics on every screen size.

⚙️ Pure Web Tech
No React, no frameworks — built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Fast, lightweight, and framework-free.
